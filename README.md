# Instagram-like Clone Product

## Introduction

We are proposing to develop an Instagram-like clone product that will allow users to share photos and communicate with others. The product will have a backend written in Python, utilizing Flask, YOLOv8, and MariaSQL packages. When users upload pictures, an automated system will scan images and extract details about them. We will use a SQL database to store user data and image information. The frontend will be a standalone website, utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The frontend will communicate with the backend only via API calls.

## Objectives

The objectives of our Instagram-like clone product are:

To create a platform for users to share photos and communicate with others.
To develop an automated system for scanning images and extracting details about them.
To use a SQL database to store user data and image information.
To build a standalone frontend website utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
To ensure the frontend communicates with the backend only via API calls.

## Backend

The backend of our Instagram-like clone product will be written in Python. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python, which will be used to handle HTTP requests and responses. YOLOv8 is a computer vision library that will be used for image recognition and analysis. MariaSQL is an open-source relational database management system that will be used to store user data and image information.

## Automated Image Scanning

When users upload pictures, an automated system will scan images and extract details about them. This will be done using YOLOv8, a computer vision library that is capable of recognizing objects in images. The extracted details will be stored in the SQL database alongside the image.

## SQL Database

We will use a SQL database to store user data and image information. MariaSQL, an open-source relational database management system, will be used for this purpose. The database will store information about users, including their usernames, passwords, and email addresses. It will also store information about uploaded images, including the image file itself, the date and time of upload, and the extracted details about the image.

## Frontend

The frontend of our Instagram-like clone product will be a standalone website, utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The website will allow users to create accounts, log in, upload images, and communicate with others. The website will be designed to be easy to use and intuitive, with a modern and visually appealing interface.

## API

The frontend will communicate with the backend only via API calls. This will ensure that the two components of the product remain separate and can be developed and maintained independently. The API will be designed to be secure, efficient, and scalable, allowing the product to handle a large number of users and images.

## Conclusion

We believe that our proposed Instagram-like clone product will be a valuable addition to the market, providing users with a platform to share photos and communicate with others. Our use of Python, Flask, YOLOv8, and MariaSQL will ensure that the product is efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain. The standalone frontend website utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS will provide users with a modern and visually appealing interface, while the use of API calls will ensure that the frontend and backend remain separate and secure.
